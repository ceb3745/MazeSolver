    Had to redo my entire find path function to instead of use a million
    queues use two parrallel arrays. One boolean array that contains
    whether that node has been visited and one integer array that increases
    value as it goes through the path. I fixed getopt to work with a file
    pointer and ended up having nasty function parameters because
    of the no global variable rule.

    Currently have gone in and out of hell with this code. I got the
    solution to work if it was a 2 by 2 array, as soon as there was a larger array, I ran into problems. I didn't know we had to take non square arrays so now I
    have to go back into the program and reconfigure everything to work for any
    dimensions n by m of matrix. I added in the getopt for the different functionalities. I also added in the change of how the input it taken in based on the
    flag. I created the functions findNeighbors, findNode, and findPlace all to
    aid me in the execution. I need to implement the pretty print and the sort of
    best path outside of findPlace so that I can add the optional arguement. Currently the final possible path is only working with the finalPath being a global
    variable. When I try to return it from the function and reassign it, it doesn't
    work and actually just reassigns the values to NULL.
